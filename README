### Installation and Requirements###

You should be able to run the code with MATLAB R2010b or later. 
The package including one section of my own toolbox, if you want you
could download the full version from the following github website: 

    github.com/lbl1985/toolbox

Our research is heavily depended on [1]'s work. You could be able to
check their code at their own website:

    http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/wang/dense_trajectories

Our package will continue two version of binary files compiled from
their source code.

Later on, you could also download the more up to date (such as C++ and
CUDA implementation) code from repo:

      github.com/lbl1985/hankelet

### Tests ###

There are two testing sections in script: mainProcedure.m One is for
Mass processing and the other is for labeling visualization.

Run the following code in MATLAB terminal: 

>> mainProcedure

---- Test  Section 1 ---- 
This section loads the testData.mat, which is velocity information
extracted from experiment. 

This sections includes Kmeans Clustering and Labeling
subsections. These two steps are the essential for our hankelet in [2].


Based on these procedure, other researchers could proposed their own
experiment settings for various datasets. 

---- Test  Section 2 ---- 
This section loads person_trial.mat, which is exacted from
person01_boxing_d1_uncomp video in KTH dataset by using the two binary
files located in 90support/dense_binary. One for absolute value and
the other for corresponding velocity. 

The variable X_train is extracted from "corresponding velocity" (:,
8:37)';
and varialbe trajectory is extracted from "absolute" (:, 8:37);

Since the "corresponding velocity" is the information we processed in
our algorithm for clustering and labeling. The absolute is only for
visulaization usage.
